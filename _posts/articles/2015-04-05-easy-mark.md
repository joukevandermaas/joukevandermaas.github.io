excerpt: In which I introduce a new hobby project.
title: Introducing EasyMark, a Simple Markdown Viewer
---

As I was setting up this blog, I quickly realized Markdown was going to become
an important tool for me. Since this blog is set up using [Jekyll], it makes sense
for me to use some local text editor to write posts. Since I'm already used to
Vim, I figured I'd just use that.

Here is where I ran into problems. I looked around for a simple tool that just
renders a markdown file locally and presents it to me, but I could not find any
for Windows. All I could find were combined editor/viewers.


After my initial surprise, I figured I'd just write my own. First of all,
it will give me something to write about. More importantly though, it'll be
a nice hobby project that I can slowly improve. I will write here about my
thought process implementing the various features I have in mind.

For now all it does is render the markdown into a very simple template (which
is customizable). While this is already useful, I plan to add more (cooler)
things to it over time. These things will never include an editor, because that
would go against the very idea of the project.

If you are interested, see the [Github Repo](https://github.com/joukevandermaas/easymark)
for the source code and other downloads. Keep in mind this project is still
very much in the basic phase; it currently does barely anything and I cannot
guarantee it is stable.
